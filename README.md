## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cameron

I'm a student at Cornell University studying computer science, with particular interest in its applications in spaceflight. 

I'm also interested in systems and networking (particularly operating systems), as well as UX design and human-computer interaction. In my free time I enjoy building modern and efficient macOS apps. I'm also a huge baseball fan and [movie](https://letterboxd.com/camgoddard/) lover.
